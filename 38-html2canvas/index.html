        <p>How does it work?
            The script renders the current page as a canvas image, by reading the DOM and the different styles applied
            to the elements.

            It does not require any rendering from the server, as the whole image is created on the client's browser.
            However, as it is heavily dependent on the browser, this library is not suitable to be used in nodejs. It
            doesn't magically circumvent any browser content policy restrictions either, so rendering cross-origin
            content will require a proxy to get the content to the same origin.

            The script is still in a very experimental state, so I don't recommend using it in a production environment
            nor start building applications with it yet, as there will be still major changes made.
